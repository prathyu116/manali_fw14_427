1)  how to add comments on css?
    place your plain text inside /* */ marks
    Eg /* This is a single-line comment */
     p {
     color: red;
}



2)Why do we use pseudo-class?
A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state 
of the selected element(s). For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color 
when the user's pointer hovers over it.

/* Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering */
button:hover {
  color: blue;
}




3)How is specificity applied?
If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest
 specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element. 
 Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declaration are ultimately applied to an element.


4)What method allows an element to be moved from its current position?
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
There are five different position values:
static
relative
fixed
absolute
sticky
Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will
 not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.


6)What is the difference between flex and grids?
 The basic difference between CSSgrid layout and Css flexbox layout is that the flexbox was 
 designed for layout  in one dimension whether it is in row or column while grid was designed for
 two dimensional layout rows column same time.




7)Give an example where we have to use grids and where you have to use flexbox?
If i want to place my div in one direction whether in row or in column we will use flex there.whereas if i want to work in two dimentions then 
we will be using grid.



8)Give an example where you cannot use flexbox, and you can only use grids?
If you are using flexbox and find yourself disabling some of the flexibility, you probably need to use CSS Grid Layout.
 An example would be if you are setting a percentage
 width on a flex item to make it line up with other items in a row above. In that case, a grid is likely to be a better choice



9)What are combinators? give examples of how you can use them
A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
There are four different combinators in CSS:

descendant selector (space)
child selector (>)
adjacent sibling selector (+)
general sibling selector (~)

Descendant Selector
The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.
The following example selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements: 
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}


Child Selector (>)
The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.
The following example selects all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element:
div > p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".
The following example selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements:
div + p {
  background-color: yellow;
}


General Sibling Selector (~)
The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.
The following example selects all <p> elements that are next siblings of <div> elements:
div ~ p {
  background-color: yellow;
}


10)What does object-fit do?
The object-fit CSS property sets how the content of a replaced element, such as an <img> or <video> , 
should be resized to fit its container. You can alter the alignment of the replaced element's content 
object within the element's box using the object-position property.



11)What does rotate do?
The rotate() CSS function defines a transformation that rotates an element around a fixed point
 on the 2D plane, without deforming it. Its result is a <transform-function> data type.
 The rotate() CSS function defines a transformation that rotates an element around a fixed point on the 2D plane, without deforming it. Its result is a <transform-function> data type.
The fixed point that the element rotates around — mentioned above — is also known as the transform origin. This defaults to the center of the element, but you can set your own custom
 transform origin using the transform-origin property.
syntax=rotate(a)
HTML
<div>Normal</div>
<div class="rotated">Rotated</div>
 
Copy to Clipboard
CSS
div {
  width: 80px;
  height: 80px;
  background-color: skyblue;
}

.rotated {
  transform: rotate(45deg); /* Equal to rotateZ(45deg) */
  background-color: pink;
}




13)When working with attribute selectors, how can you select elements which contain a particular attribute value?
It is possible to style HTML elements that have specific attributes or attribute valuesThe [attribute*="value"] selector is
 used to select elements whose attribute value contains a specified value. The following example selects all elements with a
  class  attribute value that contains "te": Note: The value does not have to be a whole word
[class$="test"] {
  background: yellow;
}



 14)What does @media do?
The @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices. Media queries can be
 used to check many things, such as: width and height of the viewport. width and height of the device.


 16)What is the ranking of selectors with respect to specificity?
There are four distinct categories which define the specificity level of a given selector: inline styles, IDs, classes,
 attributes, and elements. 32)What is the ranking of selectors with respect to specificity?
There are four distinct categories which define the specificity level of a given selector: inline styles, 
IDs, classes, attributes, and elements.



17)how can we apply same styles to multiple selectors?
We can give them the same class name by doing this we will able to apply same style to multiple selectors.
When you group CSS selectors, you apply the same styles to several different elements without repeating the styles in your stylesheet.
 Instead of having two, three, or more CSS rules that do the same thing
 (set the color of something to red, for example), you use a single CSS rule that accomplishes the same thing.
